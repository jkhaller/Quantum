Developing a complete (HW/SW) kit for Automations 

We are a group of two people that are building a box (size of AppleTV) with a RISC chip and a graphical user interface with everything out of the box. It supports all known standards, like Matter, ZigBee, Wifi, BT etc. No third party hub needed but it can be integrated in the Apple Homekit system (but thats not mandatory.
